# Flight Schedule

click here to demo: https://mattyb1980.github.io/FlightSchedule/

This is a basic scheduling app where you can view a flights destination, frequency of arrivals, time of next arrival, and how much time until next arrival.
This application uses HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Moment.js, and Firebase.

## Future Development.

Would like to get it where the individual panel refreshes the times without refreshing the whole page.
